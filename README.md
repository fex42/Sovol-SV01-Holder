# Sovol-SV01-Holder

This is a non-invasive mount for a board fan and two step-down-converters (needed for 12V fans and lower voltages) in the Sovol SV01.

Note that on the pictures the build was not finished (some wiring, cable management and the second step-down still missing). But as you can see in one picture, the slim fan does fit into the case, so you don't need to raise the feet. You just need to make a new housing cover with the corresponding opening for the fan.

The used fan is this cheap 70x70x10mm fan (driven with 8-9V it is very quiet while still cooling enough):

The step-down converters are this common LM2596 parts:

To avoid the need for support, it consists of two parts that will be screwed together with three M3x12 screws. The fan also screwed with four M3x8 screws. The base is mounted in the case with two M3x5 screws on the existing screw-sockets of the case.

The part is my fist try with this great Round-Anything library that makes creating rounded parts in OpenSCAD easier:
